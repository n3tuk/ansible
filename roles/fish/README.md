# n3t.uk Fish Ansible Role

An Ansible role for the installation and configuration of the [fish][fish-shell]
shell utility on the server, with a basic configuration file.

[fish-shell]: https://fishshell.com/

## Requirements

None other than the Ansible Role.

## Bootstrap Support

This role provides support for the bootstrapping process used to install Arch
Linux via the LiveUSB installation image to a working server, via either
physical or virtual hosts.

The `bootstrap_mount_base` variable is checked and if a directory is provided
(i.e. `/mnt`), then the role will deposit the files under that directory, or run
the command via `arch-chroot` into the new installation.
